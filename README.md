# Comparison-of-Blind-Source-Separation-techniques

This sample software applies Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms to simulated convolutive mixtures in order to compare separation performance.

## 1 - Offline BSS comparison
* The main file to run comparison:
"main_offline_bss_separation.m": AIRES vs TRINICON vs ILRMA vs AuxIVA

The main executable file separates convolutive mixture using our proposed Time Domain Stereo Audio Source Separation technique (AIRES)[1], time domain TRINICON[2], frequency domain BSS ILRMA[3,4] and AuxIVA[5]. For evaluation the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio, Signal-to-Interference Ratio and computation time for all 4 BSS are printed.

* How to change convolutive mixtures:

simply uncomment in the beginning of the file desired line with FileName "fname". 

Pay attention - all BSS work only with audio signals of 16kHz sampling rate.

## 2 - Online BSS comparison
* The main file to run comparison:
"main_online_bss_separation.m": AIRES vs TRINICON

The main executable file separates convolutive mixture using our proposed Time Domain Stereo Audio Source Separation technique (AIRES)[1], online time domain TRINICON[2]. For evaluation the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio, Signal-to-Interference Ratio and mean computation time per signal block are printed.

* How to change convolutive mixtures:

simply uncomment in the beginning of the file desired line with FileName "fname". 

Pay attention - all BSS work only with audio signals of 16kHz sampling rate.
